**Namma Yatri Data Analysis with SQL and Power BI**

__Project Description__
This project involves a comprehensive analysis of data from the "Namma Yatri" app, aiming to understand user behavior, conversion rates, completed trips, driver allocations, and trip cancellations. Leveraging SQL for data extraction and Power BI for visualization, we have derived valuable insights to optimize the app's performance and user experience.

__Results and Insights__
1. Conversion Rate Analysis
Conversion Rate: We calculated the conversion rate, which measures the percentage of users who successfully completed trips after initiating the booking process. This key metric allows us to assess the app's user engagement and conversion effectiveness.
2. Completed Trips
Trip Completion Trends: Through our analysis, we identified trends in completed trips based on factors such as time of day, day of the week, and user location. These insights can inform strategies for optimizing trip availability and user satisfaction.
3. Driver Allocation
Driver Earnings: We examined driver earnings, taking into account trip volume, distance, and fare structures. This analysis provides insights into driver performance and earnings, which can aid in driver incentivization and satisfaction.
4. Trip Cancellations
Cancellation Patterns: We analyzed trip cancellations to understand why and when users cancel bookings. Identifying common cancellation patterns can lead to improvements in trip planning and user retention strategies.
